Lung segmentation is crucial for medical image analysis, especially in diagnosing and treating respiratory diseases like pneumonia, tuberculosis, and lung cancer. This project aims to develop an automated deep learning model using the U-Net architecture for segmenting lung regions in chest X-ray images. The motivation for this project lies in the growing demand for automated medical diagnostics, as manual segmentation is time-consuming and error-prone. By providing an efficient, reliable solution, this model enhances diagnostic accuracy and streamlines workflows for healthcare professionals, making it a timely contribution to the advancement of medical image analysis through deep learning.
